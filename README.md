# Polarimetric-Autocorrelation-Matrix

## Introduction
We propose a new descriptor called polarimetric autocorrelation matrix. Different from polarimetric covariance and coherency matrices, the polarimetric autocorrelation matrix can capture hidden Doppler information in the frequency domain and encode it in the phase using higher-order statistical methods. This matrix facilitates the joint extraction and analysis of polarization and Doppler information from fully Polarimetric SAR (PolSAR) data through matrix analysis.
